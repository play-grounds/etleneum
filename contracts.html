For it to work the market creator must make an initial deposit and after that the market will never be bankrupt. A _liquidity factor_ is also specified upon market creation, it specifies basically how much capital the creator wants to deposit initially to make the market less volatile. The liquidity factor can be increased after the market is operational by calling `increaseliquidity` and making a donation to the market's funds.\n\n`exchange` can be called with either a positive or a negative number of shares. If negative, these shares will be sold and the money will be sent to the seller's account.

Alice calls `queuepay` method with `{addr, fee_msat}` and the amount of satoshis she wants to send to 3mno... + the amount of msatoshis specified. That will create a pending offer.\n  2.

Charlie has coins onchain and wants to get some satoshis on Lightning. He notices that he can send a batched transaction to 3mno... and bc1ymq... with the specified amounts in the pending offers, pay the fees and still pocket some extra sats from the sum of `fee_msat` of both offers.\n  4. Before doing anything, Charlie calls `reserve`. That will ensure he has the right to fulfill these two offers without anyone messing up with them before him. When calling `reserve` Charlie includes _200 sat_ just to keep him honest. If he doesn't fulfill the offers in the expected time (6 blocks) these sats will be added to the `fee_msat` of the two offers.\n  5. Then Charlie publishes the batched transaction to the blockchain and calls `txsent` with the transaction id. Once the transaction is confirmed he is awarded with the sats.\n\n**Other details**\n\n- Anytime a `queuepay` is called with an address for which there is already an offer, the new satoshis and fees will just be added to that offer (unless the offer is reserved, in that case the call will fail). You can use that to increase the fees if no one is taking your payment, for example.\n- Onchain transactions must have outputs with **exact** values, otherwise they won't be recognized.\n",
